                Hello, my name is Walber Rosa and I'm from MacaÃ©-RJ, Brazil. I enjoy playing the harmonica. I have been working in the offshore industry for 10 years and recently started coordinating projects. In my free time, I love exploring new technologies and generating innovative ideas to revolutionize my field. I am passionate about continuous learning and always seek out new challenges that push me to grow both personally and professionally. In addition to my technical skills, I have a strong interest in project management and team leadership. I believe in the power of collaboration and strive to foster a positive and productive work environment. Outside of work, I enjoy outdoor activities such as hiking and biking, which help me stay active and inspired. My goal is to make a meaningful impact in my industry and contribute to innovative solutions that drive progress.
